# Tableau-Excel-SQL-Project
This repository aims to combine the prior [SQL Capstone Project](https://github.com/yosefemshani/SQL-Capstone-Project/tree/main) with Tableau visualization as well as Excel Data Cleaning.

# Link to project
The final project is uploaded in this repository as [Excel_Tableau_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/yosefemshani/Tableau-Excel-SQL-Project/blob/main/Excel_Tableau_Project.ipynb).

### Aim of this project
A real-world data analysis challenge is simulated using a dataset from TechMart, a growing retail chain. All used datasets and tables can be found in this repository. Credits to Coursera for the simulated datasets. This analysis is then further visualized using Tableau.

## 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
This is highly relevant to analyze in this simulated dataset for real-life application of Data Science and Data Analysis, due to the fact that realistic complex datasets show messy data, which needs cleaning before analysis. This data cleaning is here realized within Microsoft Excel.

## 2. Data Visualization
Prior analyzed datasets are visualized within this project to demonstrate how data analysis needs proper visualization instead of numbers listed in a table.

## 3. Data Report
Finally, after cleaning and visualizing the analyzed data, this project is summarized and possible outlooks are given.
